## SiriGoesBoom

In 2015 I purchased a UE Boom 2 speaker, and much to my delight the speaker came along with an app which among other things allowed you to power the speaker on and off from the app, initially this piqued my interest as to how it was done efficiently. Fast forward a few years later and Apple releases Siri Shortcuts, allowing app developers to integrate their app with Siri and even allow users to automate certain tasks. Now, I have rather patiently been waiting for UE to add this feature to their app; to no avail. So this blog will focus on my efforts to reverse engineer the UE Boom speaker and create an app which will allow Siri to “find her voice” when talking to the UE Boom speaker.

## Getting Started

Open the project in XCode, change the developer sigining as needed and build

## Next Steps

 Hopefully if I ever get a paid developer account actually integrating with Siri
